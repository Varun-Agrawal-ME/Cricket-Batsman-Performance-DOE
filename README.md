# Cricket-Batsman-Performance-DOE
This work includes the implementation of DOE concepts such as Two-way ANOVA, randomized blocking, and full-factorial design
that consists of three independent factors (weight of the bat, type of bowler, and batting hand direction) with two levels
each and replicated six times (six days with different weather conditions). The data was analyzed using RSquare, 
RSquare adjusted, F Ratio and PValue to determine the effect of all the factors. Finally, the model was reduced (to 4-factors) by removing
all the insignificant factors and performed the analysis to validate the important factors.
